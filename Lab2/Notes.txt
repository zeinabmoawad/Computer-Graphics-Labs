1- to draw multi shapes in shader 
   1- put this with different phase for each shape
     glUniform1f(time_loc, time+1.0);// not in same phase
     glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    2-
 2-Gluint ==> unsigned integer
 3-GPU not read ram 
 4-glbind====>to not name the variable using it without name
 5-vertex array used to read from buffer and make it to vertex shader
 6-glVertexAttribPointer(loction,no.of elements in array,type,normalized or not,step,pointer begin to read)//relate vertex to buffer
 7-can make two buffers(color, vertex) but should work in two buffers
 8-  make vertex then color but hard to read each vertex with it's color 
 9-layout(location=0)===>used to make const location
 10-if data not chage too much so store in GPU
